<p>Vascular plants are a group of plants characterized by having a vascular system, having true leaves, roots, etc., and having a dominant sporophyte (diploid) generation. Vascular plants are those plants, which have specialised vascular tissues for the transport of water, minerals and food. Ferns and horsetails are vascular. The vascular tissues are xylem and phloem, and the combination of one xylem and one phloem adjacent to each other is called a vascular bundle. 9.7 Nonvascular Plants Biology LibreTexts.</p>
