<p>How the body uses stored energy. Aerobics requires consistency to improve your fitness level and constantly fuel your body to burn down carbohydrates and fat. The main differences between aerobic exercise and anaerobic exercise are: Thus aerobic exercise is defined as exercise that promotes a greater oxygen intake, and cardio exercise is exercise that promotes a greater heart rate.</p>

<p>Any activity that increases the heart rate, in turn pumping oxygen around the body. It can only break down various sugars and starches. Aerobic respiration is more efficient because it uses oxygen to break down glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids and is the primary method the body produces adenosine triphosphate (atp), which provides energy to the muscles. It reflects the ability to function effectively in normal daily activity and can be assessed with field tests such as the pacer or walking test. Routine exercisebased cardiac rehabilitation does not increase aerobic.</p>
