<p>Muscle energy technique (met) is a technique that was developed in 1948 by fred mitchell, sr, d.o [1]. This is our energy reserve to fuel activity and bodily functions. Muscular strength is the ability to exert maximal force in one single contraction, such as lifting a weight that you could lift only once before needing a short break. You can put in loads of effort, and thereâs no time constraint.</p>
