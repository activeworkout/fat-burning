Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions is an international journal covering the broad field of cardiovascular diseases. Cardiac catheterization, also called a heart cath, is done to examine the vessels, valves, and other parts of the heart. Check for signs of disease. The calculated effective dose if the operator wears the correct lead apron and thyroid collar is less than 5 msv /year.

<p>Cardiac catheterization, also known as cardiac cath or heart catheterization, is a medical procedure used to diagnose and treat some heart conditions. Cardiac catheterization gives doctors important information about the heart muscle, heart valves. Cardiac catheter is a minimally invasive test that can be done before a cardiac procedure, catheterization of the heart, or cardiovascular disease treatment. (this procedure is called an âangiogram.â) if a blockage is detected, it can be opened through a procedure called âangioplastyâ or âstent Interventional and Structural Heart Disease Cardiovascular Division.</p>
