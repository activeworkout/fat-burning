<p>Your velocity increases and you become stronger because the anaerobic training increases your force and muscular mass. Energy comes from food which is converted into glucose and for the most efficient energy supply muscles also need oxygen. Most of our cells prefer to get their energy by using oxygen to fuel metabolism. In relation to the anatomy and physiology of the circulatory system, when an individual undertakes a strenuous exercise, more energy is demanded than can be provided by aerobic respiration since oxygen cannot be obtained rapidly enough.
